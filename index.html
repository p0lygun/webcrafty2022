                        <span class="read-start">G</span>lobal climate change refers to the rise of earth's temperature, caused by human factors. It originates from the greenhouse effect of certain gases in our atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) that block the escaping heat. The concentration of these gases has risen dramatically by human impact since the mid of the 20th century, with the burning of fossil fuels (oil and gas) and deforestation being main causes of this rise. The observed and expected effects include more and longer periods of draught, wildfires and an increased number of extreme weather events.

                        Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.
                        Hotter temperatures
                        
                        Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.

                            <h4>More severe storms</h4>

                            Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of dollars.

                            <h4> Increased drought</h4>

                            Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis.

                            <h4> Effects of climate change specifically on India:</h4>
                            India's average temperature has risen by around 0.7°C during 1901–2018. By the end of the 21st century, average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4°C relative to the recent past (1976–2005 average).
                            The frequency of summer (April-June) heat waves over India is projected to be 3 to 4 times higher by the end of the 21st century, with amplification of heat stress expected across India, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins.
                            Sea surface temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean has risen by 1°C on average during 1951–2015, markedly higher than the global average SST warming of 0.7°C, over the same period. 
                            The summer monsoon precipitation has declined by around 6% from 1951 to 2015, with notable decreases over the Indo-Gangetic Plains and the Western Ghats. 
                            This overall decrease of seasonal summer monsoon rainfall has led to an increased propensity for droughts over <img src="/static/images/heat.jpg" alt="heat" width="200px" style="float: left;"> India. 
                            Sea-level rise in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) has accelerated to 3.3 mm per year in the 1993–2017, which is comparable to the current rate of global mean sea-level rise.
                            There has been a significant reduction in the annual frequency of tropical cyclones over the NIO basin, but in contrast, the frequency of very severe cyclonic storms (VSCSs) during the post-monsoon season has increased significantly.
                            India is projected to potentially lose between 0.8 and 2 percent of its GDP by mid-century

                        Solar Activity– While the sun goes through natural cycles, increasing and decreasing the amount of energy that it emits to the earth, contributes to climate change. 
                        Agriculture- From deforestation in places like the Amazon to the transportation and livestock that it takes to support agricultural efforts around the world, agriculture is responsible for a significant portion of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
                        Deforestation- Climate change increases deforestation by way of wildfires and other extreme weather, but deforestation is also a major contributor to global warming through emission of CO2.
                        Human activity- Transportation in the form of cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes emits the largest percentage of CO2–speeding up global warming and remaining a significant cause of climate change.

                        At the 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26), Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a five-fold strategy, termed as the ‘Panchamrita’.
                        By the year 2070, India will achieve the target of Net Zero.
                        India will get its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatt (GW) by 2030.
                        India will meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.
                        India will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030.
                        By 2030, India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45 per cent.
                        India has abstained from signing a global deal made at COP26 to reduce emissions of methane gas.
                        India has resisted setting overall reduction targets, saying industrialised nations should bear a much greater share of the burden as they have contributed far more towards global warming over time.
                           According to the IPCC, global emissions must halve by 2030 and reach Net Zero by 2050. Given the enormous inequity in emissions in the world, the OECD countries must then reach Net Zero by 2030, China by 2040 and India and the rest of the world by 2050. However, OECD countries have declared a Net Zero target for 2050 and China for 2060.
